## What did I build?

["New greenland"](https://github.com/Willmakeyoupround/My-map/blob/main/My-map) This is a map that shows places in the world. The thing is that it shows places that is important to me.



## Tech stack

To build this app, I used the following tools:

1. [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps).
2. [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/guides) library, for styling and displaying maps and route lines, and adding camera behaviors (flyto animations).
4. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) free IDE, with [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) and [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) extensions.
5. [GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site), for publishing the app for free!
